Executable WAR
==============

Taking ideas from Hudson and Google Gerrit, this project aims at providing
a relatively easy way for developers to make WAR files self-runnable,
while still deployable to a standard servlet container.

To achieve this goal, we provide a sample Maven recipe that a developer
can use, and a launcher class that will take care of making direct
execution of the WAR possible.

To find out more, please see the Javadoc pages.
